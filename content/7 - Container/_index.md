In this series of exercises, I learned how to work again with Docker containers and docker-compose to deploy a Java 
application connected to a MySQL database. The main focus was on understanding how to set up and manage containers, 
configure environment variables, and deploy a multi-container application using docker-compose.

Most of the time we just work with Kubernetes, so this was a great opportunity to get back to basics.

By working through these exercises, I gained practical experience in:

1. Running a MySQL container and setting environment variables for database connectivity. 
2. Starting a MySQL GUI container (phpMyAdmin) and connecting it to the MySQL container. 
3. Creating a docker-compose file to manage multiple containers, including volumes and dependencies. 
4. Dockerizing a Java application and creating a Dockerfile. 
5. Building and pushing a Docker image to a hosted repository. 
6. Adding a Java application to a docker-compose file and configuring environment variables. 
7. Deploying a multi-container application on a server using docker-compose. 
8. Opening ports on a server firewall to enable access to the application. 

These exercises provided me with hands-on experience in deploying a Java application connected to a MySQL database 
using Docker and docker-compose. In the end, I developed a deeper understanding of containerization and how it can 
be used to simplify application deployment and management.

This was also helpful for the mentioned PoC in the previous chapter.
