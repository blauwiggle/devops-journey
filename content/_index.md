# Introduction
Hello, my name is Michael, and I am a DevOps Engineer currently working for a tech company in Germany. I recently 
relocated to Vienna, specifically in the 23rd district. 

## My Motivation
I've been an avid follower of your YouTube content, and after completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science 
last year, I was inspired to take this course to enhance my understanding of the various tools I use daily. As 
you've often highlighted, navigating the plethora of tools can be daunting, and I aim to gain a comprehensive grasp 
of how they all function cohesively. My interest in cloud-native technologies also drives me to learn more about 
Kubernetes, which is why I'm pursuing your CKA as well.    

As a DevOps Engineer at a tech company, I enjoy complimentary access to AWS, meaning I don't have to worry about the 
expenses. Therefore, I plan to utilize AWS resources extensively for this documentation. In my professional projects,
we primarily use Azure, which has given me a solid foundation in this area. We've developed a cloud-native platform 
with cutting-edge features like GitOps, DataDog, and more. Presently, I am involved in an automotive project, where 
we are building a global platform. I'm also excited to begin a new project in April, focused on constructing a 
platform for a manufacturing company that involves a significant amount of IoT integration.
