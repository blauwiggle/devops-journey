I'm glad that Git exists. When I explain Git to someone, I explain it in a way that they can think of it as a time 
machine, that makes it much easier for the other person to understand. SVN was the first thing
I got to know back then and I didn't really like it. I didn't really understand it then either and
was glad when I got to know Git. In my studies the game devs used Perforce, which is quite good for the huge projects.
Anyway, I still have a lot to learn myself. One of the nicest features I think, is cherry-picking. You can easily 
pull a certain commit from another branch.
